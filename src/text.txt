 Git and GitHub flow For JavaPracticeTasks on IntelliJ:**

First you must be on your local branch. (If this is your first time and if you donâ€™t have local branch, first create your own local branch from master and checkout it.)

Right click Local Master -> click Update

Right click Local Master -> click Merge "Master" into "Zack" branch

Start to write your code. (Package names must be same - Pay attention)

Commit your changes

Push your branch.

Create your PR (Pull Request) on Github side .
